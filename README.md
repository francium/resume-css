# HTML+CSS Resume

Simple and elegant resume template based on [paper-css](//github.com/cognitom/paper-css).
Written in regular HTML+CSS and flexible styling allows for further customization.

Take a look at [print.pdf](//github.com/francium/resume-css/blob/master/print.pdf)
to see how pdf/print version would look.

# Customization

Take a look at [paper-css](//github.com/cognitom/paper-css) for page size options
(default is 'letter' in this template, 8.5in x 11in).

This template has been hard coded to fit on a single 8.5in x 11in paper without overflow
onto multiple pages (which can easily be removed, see `<body>` of `index.html`).

See `resume.css` for all other customization needs.
